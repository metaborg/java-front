  * pp/Makefile.am: Include sdf/gpp, not sdf/box-tools.

2002-11-23  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Small changes to configure.in to profit from new
    autotools.

2002-11-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Ad-hoc solution for parentheses around expressions
    in for-loop. A more powerfull solution for
    priorities must fix this later.

2002-11-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Added the last missing pretty printing constructs.
    Thanks to Stefan Reich for mentioning this problem.

2002-11-18  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Added priority for array access. I have to figure
    out if this according to the JLS.

2002-09-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Removed the priorities of yesterday. Eelco Visser
    pointed out that because of the interpretation of
    priorities a while in the then branch of an if-else
    is no longer allowed. A prefer on the if-then solves
    everything.

  * Added context-free priorities for while, for,
    and the labeled statement. if-then-else > if-then
    doesn't solve all dangling else problems. Now
    it should work (unit-tests available in de statement
    test-suite).

2002-09-14  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Added a production for generic methods 
   in interfaces. I forgot this one.

2002-08-29  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Implemented pretty-printing of while.

  * Implemented pretty-printing of (Q)NewInstance
    with class-bodies for Generic Java and classic Java

2002-08-27  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * configure.in improved after some tips of Merijn
    de Jonge.

  * Added package definition (created by Merijn de Jonge)
    for the Online Package Base. java front and the
    various required tools can now be
    downloaded as a bundle from the Online Package Base.

2002-08-26  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Added a script "parse-java" to parse Java or 
    Generic Java code.

  * Moved all scripts to "scripts"

2002-08-25  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Fixed huge priority bug with method invocation and
    field access: Expr "." Id must have highest priority

2002-08-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Added anti quotation for literals to Stratego-Java.sdf

2002-08-22  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Modified pp-Java-Literals to workaround concrete
    syntax bug in Stratego.

  * Implemented pretty-printing for the if construct
    and throw in pp-Java-Statement.

2002-08-21  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Implemented pretty-printing in pp-Generic-Java.

  * Created Generic-Java.sdf, a testsuite and Stratego
    signature generation for Generic-Java.

  * Restructured method invocation

  * Removed distinction TopLevel/Member/Local TypeDecs

2002-08-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Added LocalClassDec -> BlockStm

2002-08-19  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Implemented pretty-printer

2002-08-05  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Implemented parse-unit and started a decent testsuite

2002-08-04  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Solved the array creation <-> array access ambiguity
    with a reject.

2002-07-30  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Added priorities for binary expressions.

2002-07-29  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Initial version of Java-Expressions module.
